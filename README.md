# Predicting-Fraud-in-Financial-Payment-Services

This project focuses on building and benchmarking machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in e-commerce, helping reduce financial losses and improving customer experience. The project uses a large-scale dataset from Vesta Corporation, which provides real-world data on e-commerce transactions with various features, from device type to product information. Effective fraud detection can save consumers and businesses millions of dollars by accurately identifying fraud while minimizing false positives.

## Project Overview
Imagine standing in line at a grocery store, only to have your card unexpectedly declined. With higher accuracy fraud detection, customers could be spared these awkward moments, and businesses could reduce revenue loss from fraud.

This project leverages machine learning techniques on an extensive dataset provided by Vesta Corporation, a leader in e-commerce payment solutions. Our objective is to train and optimize models capable of predicting fraud in real-time for e-commerce transactions, ensuring high accuracy and minimal false positives to enhance customer experience and safeguard revenue.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by Vesta Corporation includes:
- **Transaction Features**: Details such as device type, purchase amount, and payment method.
- **User Information**: Metadata related to the user, anonymized to protect privacy.
- **Product Features**: Details about the items involved in the transaction.
  
This dataset represents a wide range of real-world e-commerce transactions and their respective fraud labels, making it ideal for training and testing fraud detection models. 

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build an accurate fraud detection model that:
1. Identifies fraudulent transactions in e-commerce with high precision.
2. Minimizes false positives to reduce unnecessary transaction declines for legitimate customers.
3. Supports large-scale, real-time fraud detection for deployment in real-world payment systems.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on existing data to enhance model accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: Experiment with various machine learning models, such as decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural networks.
4. **Evaluation**: Benchmark models using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
5. **Optimization**: Fine-tune the model to improve detection accuracy while reducing the false positive rate.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-ecommerce.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection-ecommerce
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place the dataset in the designated data folder.
2. Run the notebook or script for preprocessing, feature engineering, and training the models.
3. Use the evaluation metrics provided to assess model performance.

## Acknowledgements
The dataset for this project is provided by **Vesta Corporation**. Founded in 1995, Vesta Corporation pioneered the process of fully guaranteed card-not-present (CNP) payment transactions and is now a leader in guaranteed e-commerce payments, ensuring over $18 billion in transactions annually. Their partnership with the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) for this competition aims to improve fraud detection in payment services through data science and machine learning.
